This script take a list of names and formats it to 'last name, first name'. 

Example input: Mark J Twain Jr
               John P Wilson
               Tom Anderson
        Output: 'Twain, Mark"
                'Wilson, John'
                'Anderson, Tom'
                
The output naming convention can be ran against an SQL database.
Important to Note:
1. The full name must be in an excel speadsheet under one column. If Firstname and Lastname is in separate cells then the script will need to be modified. 
2. The pandas library will need to be installed.
